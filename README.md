# Rocket Model with ESP32 Communication

This project involves designing and simulating a rocket model using OpenRocket and FreeCAD, combined with real-time acceleration through ESP32-based communication. The main goal was to achieve live communication between the rocket and the ground using ESPNow protocol, allowing for low-latency, peer-to-peer data exchange during the flight. Additionally, a buzzer system was implemented to recover rocket after landing.

## Features
- **Rocket Design**: Base for rocket model was designed in [OpenRocket](https://openrocket.info/) which also enables flight simulations. For further processing [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/) was helpful. All parts are available in [model directory](model/stl_files/)
- **Motors**: Rocket motors used: [A6-4, B4-4](https://www.scorpio-polska.pl/katalog/klima/klima-silnik-rakietowy-a6-4-b4-4-c6-7-2-2-2-p68365.html) and [PS-16-A](https://www.modelmania.eu/silnik-do-rakiety-ps-16-a-1szt-125935)
- **Embedded programming**: Utilized ESP32 development boards for their built-in Wi-Fi capabilities, enabling real-time communication between the rocket and ground station using the ESPNow protocol. Two ESP32 boards were used: Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C3 (transmitter) and [ESP32-Pico](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/m5stickc-plus-esp32-pico-mini-iot-development-kit) (receiver) which was build in M5StickC plus, both programmed using [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/).
- **Flight Recovery**: Integrated a parachute and buzzer system, programmed using interrupts, to assist in locating the rocket post-flight.
- **Data processing**: Python helps with live data projection and collecting it to csv file.  

## Technologies Used
- **OpenRocket**: For simulating the rocket's flight dynamics.
- **FreeCAD**: For 3D modeling and design.
- **ESP32 with ESPNow**: For wireless communication between the rocket and ground control.
- **Python**: For collecting data from serial port and data poltting.
